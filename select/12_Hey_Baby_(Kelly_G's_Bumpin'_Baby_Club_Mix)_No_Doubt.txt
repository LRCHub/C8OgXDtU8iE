Hey baby, baby All the boys say
Hey, hey... All the boys say Hey, hey... Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Hey baby, hey baby, hey

I'm the kind of girl
That hangs with the guys
Like a fly in the wall
With my secret eyes
Taking it in
Try to be feminine
With my make-up bag
Watching all the sin

Misfit, I sit
Lit up, wicked
Everybody is surrounded by the girls
With the tank tops and the flirty words

I'm just sipping on chamomile
I'm watching boys and girls and their sex appeal
With a stranger in my face who says he knows my mom
And went to my high school

All the boys say
Hey baby, hey baby
Girls say, girls say
Hey baby, baby
All the boys say
Hey baby, hey baby
Girls say, girls say
Hey baby, baby

Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Girls say, girls say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Hey baby, baby
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Boys say, boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
All the boys get the girls in the back

I'm the one they feed upon
Give a bit a star is born
And if you have enough you'll get the pass
And you can tell your friends how you made it back

No matter what they say I'm still the same
Somehow everybody knows my name
And all the girls wanna get with the boys
And the boys really like it

All the boys say
Hey baby, hey baby
Girls say, girls say
Hey baby, baby
All the boys say
Hey baby, hey baby
Girls say, girls say
Hey baby, baby

Hey, hey... All the boys say Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Girls say, girls say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Hey baby, baby
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Boys say, boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
All the boys get the girls in the back

Jum, jum, jum, jum
Jump on the stage
Jump
Jump on the stage
Jump

Jump on the stage cause we going crazy
Afterward myself and one of them gorgeous ladies
There is no need to be actin' shady
C'mon baby, hey, hey baby
When you rock your hips you know that it amazes me
Got me off the hook and nutting else don't phase me
Can you be my one and only sunshine lady
If no, maybe, hey baby

Hey, hey... I'm just sipping on chamomile
I'm watching boys and girls and their sex appeal
With a stranger in my face who says he knows my mom
And went to my high school

All the boys say
Hey baby, hey baby
Girls say, girls say
Hey baby, baby
All the boys say
Hey baby, hey baby
Girls say, girls say
